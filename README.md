Programmer, Web Developer
-------------------------

Welcome to my portfolio, a testament to my journey, expertise, and passion for programming and technology. As a graduate from Parahyangan Catholic University with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, I have dedicated myself to mastering a diverse array of technologies and honing my skills as a programmer. 

My proficiency spans across a wide spectrum of languages and frameworks, including ReactJS, NextJS, ExpressJS, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, TailwindCSS, Java, JavaSpring, and Ruby on Rails. With a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development, I am equipped to tackle any project with confidence and precision. 

My professional journey has been marked by a series of impactful experiences that have shaped me into the programmer I am today. During my time at WGS, I spent 7 months providing IT support and development for Java-Spring applications, gaining valuable hands-on experience and deepening my understanding of software development principles. 

At Multipolar, I delved into backend API development for 3 months, further refining my skills and expanding my expertise in crafting scalable and secure backend solutions. This experience allowed me to gain insight into the intricate workings of backend architecture and solidify my foundation in backend development. 

However, it was my involvement in the collaborative project between SBR, SEI, and IM3 that truly showcased my abilities as a full-stack web developer. Over the course of 4 months, I played a pivotal role in developing a dynamic and innovative web application, seamlessly integrating frontend and backend technologies to deliver a user-centric solution. 

In 2024, I graduated from Purwadikha Digital Technology School's Full-stack Web Development Job Connector Program, further enhancing my skills and staying at the forefront of the latest web development trends and technologies. Let's innovate together and shape the future of technology.
